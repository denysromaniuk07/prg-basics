### 3.2
# A program that calculates the sum of two numbers.
# Modify the program to calculate the sum of three numbers.

# number1 = 71
# number2 = 14
# number3 = 10
# result = number1 + number2 + number3 
# print('Number 1: ', number1)
# print('Number 2: ', number2)
# print('Number 3: ', number3)
# print('The result of summation: ', result)

# 3.3
# A program for swapping two varable values
#
# x = 7
# y = 34
# z = 0 # additional, auxiliary variable
# print("Before swapping: x=", x, "y=", y)

# swap the values

# x = y
# y = z
# y =x

# print("After swapping: x=", x, "y=", y)


### 3.4
# A program that, for a given speed in km/h,
# prints the speed in m/s
#

# speed_kmh = 70
# speed_ms = 70*3600
# print(speed_kmh, "km/h = ", speed_ms, "m/s")


### 3.5
# A program that calculates the length of the diagonal
# of a rectangle with sides a and b.
#
# import math
# a = 5
# b = 2
# diagonal = math.sqrt(a**2+b**2)
# print(diagonal)

### 3.6

# import math 

# h1 = 183/100
# d1 = 3.57 * math.sqrt(h1/1000)

# print(d1)

# h2 = 20 + 183/100
# d2 = 3.57 * math.sqrt(h2/100)



### 3.7
# A program that calculates and prints:
# - the number of people and percentage of the total
#   population living in the Northern Hemisphere
# - the number of people and percentage of the total
#   population living in the Southern Hemisphere
#

# total = 8000000000
# north = 7200000000
# south = total-north
# print("World population: ", total)
# print("Northern Hemisphere: ", north)
# print("Northern Hemisphere in %: ", north/total*100)
# print("Southern Hemisphere: ", south)
# print("Southern Hemisphere in %: ", south / total * 100)
