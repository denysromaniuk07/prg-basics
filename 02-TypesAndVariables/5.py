### 5.1
# A program that reads your first and last name from the keyboard.
# Store this data in two separate variables.
# Then, print your full name i.e. first and last name separated by a single space.

# first_name = input('Enter your first name: ')
# last_name = input('Enter your last name: ')
# full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name 
# print(f'Your first name is {first_name} and your last name is {last_name}')
# print(f'And your full name is {full_name}')

### 5.2
# A program to calculate the volume and surface area of ​​a cube.
# 
# cube_side_string = input('Enter cube side: ')
# cube_side = int(cube_side_string)
# cube_volume = cube_side ** 3
# cube_surface_area = 6 * (cube_side ** 2)

# print(f'The volume of a cube with side {cube_side} is {cube_volume}')
# print(f'The surface area of a cube with side {cube_side} is {cube_surface_area}')

### 5.3

# A program that calculates the volume
# and surface area of ​​a cuboid with sides a, b, and c.
# Read the dimensions of the cuboid from the keyboard.
#
# a = float(input('a = '))
# b = float(input('b = '))
# c = float(input('c = '))

# cuboid_volume = a * b * c

# cuboid_surface_area = 2 * (a * b + b * c + a * c)

# print(f'The volume of the cuboid is {cuboid_volume}')
# print(f'The surface area of the cuboid is {cuboid_surface_area}')

### 5.4

# amount = float(input("Enter the amount: "))

# vat = amount * 0.23

# print(f"Amount  : {amount}")
# print(f"VAT 23% : {vat}")

### 5.5

# price = float(input("Enter price: "))
# discount_percentage = float(input("Enter discount %: "))

# reduction = price * (discount_percentage / 100)
# discounted_price = price - reduction

# print(f"Original price: {price}")
# print(f"Discount percentage: {discount_percentage}%")
# print(f"Price with discount : {discounted_price}")
# print(f"Reduction: {reduction}")
